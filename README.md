# Stock Market Portfolio Optimization
Developed a Python-based solution for optimizing stock market portfolios using quantitative finance techniques to maximize returns and minimize risk. Collected and preprocessed stock price data using Yahoo Finance API, performing exploratory data analysis to identify trends and correlations between different stocks. Implemented Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Sharpe Ratio to construct an optimal portfolio, effectively balancing risk and return. Utilized Monte Carlo simulations to assess portfolio performance under different market conditions. Created visualizations such as Efficient Frontier plots and correlation heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present optimization results and investment insights. Achieved a well-diversified portfolio with maximized risk-adjusted returns, demonstrating proficiency in quantitative finance and portfolio management techniques.
